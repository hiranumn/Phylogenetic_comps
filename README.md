Phylogenetic_comps
==================
You can check out the original repository at https://www.assembla.com/spaces/phylogeniccomps/wiki.

This is a comps graduating project at Carleton College from Fall 2013 to Summer 2014.
This project tries to evaluate the feasibility and efficiency of various multiple sequence alignment (MSA) algorithms
and phylogenetic reconstruction algirithms using both real data and synthetic data.

Below is the list of algorithms that were considered in this project:

MSA ALGORITHMS:
- ClustalW
- MUSCLE
- CENTER STAR

PHYLOGENETIC RECONSTRUCTION ALGORITHMS:
- NEIGHBOR JOINING APPROACH
- MARKOV CHAIN MONTE CARLO FOR BAYSIAN ANALYSIS
- MAXIMUM PARSIMONY APPROACH
- MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD APPROACH

See PhyloCompsPaper.pdf for more detailed description of the project.
