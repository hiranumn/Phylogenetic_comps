WHAT THIS IS:
This program generates a random phylogenetic tree

REQUIRES:
- Boost Graph Library
- Files within Phylo: KEEP THIS FILE WHERE IT IS IN THE DIRECTORY STRUCTURE

HOW TO BUILD:
cmake .
make

USAGE:
After building, we highly reccomend using generate.sh. You can put parameters into that
script, and the program will generate appropriate sequences.

You can run it outside of the script as...

./randomDataGenerator A B C D

Where
A = trialNum, any int will do, used for indexing files.
B = number of species you want in the tree.
C = the average number of base pairs you want in your final sequences.
D = the mutation rate governing the tree. We reccomend vals in [0.00001, .1]
