This program aligns sets of sequences, reconstructs phylogenetic trees from aligned
sequences, and compares phylogenetic trees.

REQUIRES:
- Boost Graph Library
- Files within Phylo: KEEP THIS FILE WHERE IT IS IN THE DIRECTORY STRUCTURE

FEAUTRES:
- 3 Sequence Alignment Algorithms
- 6 Reconstruction Algorithms
- 2 Comparison Algorithms [to run these, you need to modify main, see abstractTreeComparison.h]
- OpenMP support: set the environment OMP_NUM_THREADS to be whatever you'd like

HOW TO BUILD:
cmake .
make

USAGE:
Run ./phylo to see specific options.
